function windowVec = cepstralDistinctness(signal, rate, pitch, duration, flag)

  % Nigel Ward, January 2017
  % code derived from cepstralFlux.m; see comments there

  % One measure of phonetic reduction vs enuciation
  %  is the degree to which vowels are centralized vs distinct
  % This function measures, as a proxy, how spectrally close or far from
  %  the average are the voiced segments,
  % returns how often/strongly this happens
  % as the degree of evidence for reduction or enunciation, respectively

  % I'm being here careful to exclude unvoiced segments from consideration
  %  tho maybe if I sloppily included them, it wouldn't matter.
  % In dialog, it's probably not common for just one phoneme to be
  %  reduced, so it's probably appropriate to compute these over
  %  no less than a couple of syllables, say 300ms as a minimum window.
  % To make this a better gauge of what''s happing at syllable centers,
  %  could multiply by energy and/or exclude frames without a valid 
  %  pitch point on both sides.

  % This code fails on the Toyota data, producing lots of NaNs; don't know why.

% tested using validateFeature.m on 21d.au
% Sadly, processing of this audio file seems suffer a lot of bleeding,
%  or something: pitch points in the left track where I hear nothing.
% Although when I listen I don't hear much bleeding at all.

% Anyway, the left track, seems generally very enunciated, but
% extra-enunciated sometimes
% and sometimes reduced, e.g.
%  at the umms, e.g. 5.5, 19, 61.5, 93
%  and at quiet afterthoughts, 25.5, 31.5
%  and at discourse markers, 19.4, 81, 115.5
%  etc 71.5, 106.5
% examining the 'cd' and 'cb' plots, it generally seems to do well,
%  though with a lot of noise ... maybe due to the consonants.
