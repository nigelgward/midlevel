#minicrunch.txt
# This file specifies which prosodic features to gather up, 
#  at various temporal offsets,
#  preparatory to principal component analysis.
# Thus it's a "time-crunch specification file"
#
# Nigel Ward, UTEP, December 2012

# Note that getfeaturespec.m parses this by offsets
#  so when adding new features, make sure the fields vertically align

# this set of features is just for testing the workflow; 
# larger sets will be used for the actual PCA work
# this set won't work for testing mono files; for those use minicrunch-mono.fss
